    "==\n",
    "Few, if any, linguistics programs do require an introduction to programming. That is a shame. Programming\n",
    "is a **useful tool** for linguists, just as word processing or statistics. It can help you do things\n",
    "faster and at larger scale. When I started programming in my PhD, I realized how useful even a little\n",
    "bit of programming would have been for my masters in linguistics: it would have made many term\n",
    "papers a lot easier (at least the empirical part). I hope this tutorial can be that little bit of programming\n",
    "for you and make your life a lot easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people think of professional coders when they hear *programming*, but the level of expertise you need for linguistic work does not require a special degree. *Programming is not a black art*. It\n",
    "is a skill that can be learned. Programming is actually very similar to learning a language. Sure, it\n",
    "does take some time. You can’t learn it in a day or a week. But you can already do interesting things\n",
    "after the first few lessons. You can always get better, learn more, and become more proficient, but –\n",
    "most importantly – it’s fun! Running your program and see it produce what you wanted is an amazing\n",
    "experience. You’ll see!\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to do two things: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. to take you the fear of programming, and \n",
    "2. to show you how to write code in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of presenting each concept as an isolated problem, I will\n",
    "introduce new concepts as part of **actual programs**. Don’t worry if you do not understand the full\n",
    "program at first. It will help you understand the concept better if you see it in action.\n",
    "Since this is a tutorial for linguists, I will not cover many of the more intricate aspects of\n",
    "programming—they might be indispensable for a professional programmer or computer scientist,\n",
    "but you will probably do fine without them. I will, however, use the official terms. They will be\n",
    "***marked in bold***. That will make it easier for you to search for a problem\n",
    "if you program yourself: there is a lot of information on the web about how to solve pretty much any\n",
    "problem you might encounter. You just have to know what to search for.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you start programming yourself right away! You cannot learn programming\n",
    "from reading, so feel free to copy the code and play around with it. The more you play, the better! If\n",
    "you would like the code for the scripts in this tutorial, please send me an email.\n",
    "There will also be little quizzes throughout this tutorial. The answers are at the end. Do not peek\n",
    "ahead, but try to solve the quizzes before you move on: it will help you to assess how much you\n",
    "have really understood. If you feel unsure, go back and reread it, implement it, and make sure you\n",
    "are comfortable with the concept. Some things will come easy, others take time. Don’t worry: that’s\n",
    "normal. Even many computer scientists take a long time to pick up certain concepts.\n",
    "If you get stuck, take a break. This is one of the most important principles in programming. \n",
