# Python for Linguists - a Gentle Introduction to Programming

As a linguistics undergrad, I wrote my first term paper on affixes. I spent a summer counting words by hand and collecting them in a spreadsheet. It took weeks, and once I was done, I was so tired and frustrated that I had no mind to re-run the calculations, and I had to write the actual paper in the remaining week. The outcome was predictably horrible, for everyone involved.

When I started programming in my PhD, I realized how useful even a little bit of programming would have been for that task: I could have solved the counting in a matter of minutes, and spent the rest of that summer writing a better paper and enjoying life.
My hope is that this tutorial can help make someone's life a bit easier, and to show that programming is not some black art, but a useful tool in every linguists tool box.
